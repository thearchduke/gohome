###Twitter is a thing that exists. Let's write a robot for it.
----

<span style="font-size: smaller;">(I was recently tasked with making a Twitter bot that takes inputs, asks Wolfram Alpha a question, and returns a response. So that's the example I'll be using here, more or less.)</span>

----------
*So* you want to write a Twitter bot.
------

The first thing you'll need to do is [get your Twitter API access](https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview). Make sure to read through the terms of service, since you'd hate to violate them. They even have special terms for bots! So let's follow those, OK? OK.

Next make sure that you've installed your dependencies, in this case, twitter. Are you using a [`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)? You should be.

<p><pre>virtualenv venv<br/>source venv/bin/activate<br/>pip install twitter<br/>pip freeze > requirements.txt</pre></p>

(That last line is a holdover from doing web apps on Heroku, but it's still a good practice.)

Next let's set up our configuration file. For sanity's sake, I use a separate config.py file to keep my keys and stuff outside of GitHub, and to make project templating easy.

`config.py`:
<pre>token = 'API token'<br/><br/>token_key = 'API key'<br/>con_secret = 'Consumer secret'<br/>con_secret_key = 'Consumer secret key'</pre>

And of course populate that with your own stuff.

----------
*Now* we can log our bot in. `twitter` is just a wrapper around the Twitter API with OAuth, and also happens to be all we need.

bot.py:
<pre>from twitter import Twitter, OAuth<br/>import config<br/><br/>auth=OAuth(config.token, config.token_key, config.con_secret, config.con_secret_key)<br/>twit = Twitter(auth=auth)</pre>

We now have our aptly-named session object *twit*, which we can use for the rest of the bot.

Since this bot will be responding to @replies, let's fetch those first.

<pre>def get_ats(t, username):<br/>	ats = t.statuses.mentions_timeline()<br/>	return ats</pre>

where `t` is our session. While this **does** get us a list() of our most recent @replies, it will also fetch retweets and things we've already replied to. This isn't a problem, but since we don't want to repeat ourselves (it's rude and annoying and probably violates the TOS somewhere, and just as importantly I don't want to have to store any data)...

A wiser man than myself once said, "a problem is anything that causes problems." It sounds like this is, in fact, *a problem.* So instead of doing that, we'll first fetch the tweet that our bot most recently replied to, and then fetch all our twitter mentions **since** then, filtering out retweets:

<pre><br/>def get_most_recent_ats(t, username):<br/>	# Try fetching the in_reply_to_status_ids attribute of bot's most recent tweet<br/>	try:<br/>		last_reply_id = t.statuses.user_timeline(screen_name=username)[0]['in_reply_to_status_ids']<br/>	# If the last tweet wasn't a reply to anything just fetch that<br/>	except:<br/>		try:<br/>			last_reply_id = t.statuses.user_timeline(screen_name=username)[0]['id']<br/>		# If there's some sort of other error, just set last_reply_id to 1<br/>		except:<br/>			last_reply_id = 1<br/><br/>	newest = t.statuses.mentions_timeline(include_rts=0, since_id=last_reply_id)<br/>	return newest</pre>

------------
Cool. Now let's set up the framework for our bot's main task:

<pre>def run_periodic(t, username):<br/>	ats = get_most_recent_ats(t, username)<br/>	for tweet in ats:<br/>		'''<br/>		DO SOMETHING<br/>		'''<br/>		msg = "WHATEVER I JUST DID"<br/>		to = tweet['user']['screen_name']<br/>		out = '@' + to + ' ' + msg<br/>		t.statuses.update(status=out, in_reply_to_status_id=tweet['id'])</pre>

Then I just spun up an AWS instance and set a cron job to run `run_periodic()` every minute. The fun comes with whatever you choose to do with *DO SOMETHING*.

*Have fun out there!*
