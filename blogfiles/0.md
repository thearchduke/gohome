# On Time
----
The way we organize time is a funny thing. Some of the units seem so arbitrary:

<ul>
	<li>12 months in a year</li>
	<li>28, 29, 30, or 31 days in a month</li>
	<li>24 hours in a day</li>
	<li>7 days in a week</li>
	<li>60 minutes in an hour</li>
	<li>...leap seconds??</li>
</ul>

Others, less so:

<ul>
	<li>One rotation of the earth in a day</li>
	<li>One orbit of the sun in a year (365 days, more or less)</li>
	<li>10 years in a decade, 10 decades in a century, 10 centuries...</li>
</ul>

And then, of course, we stop at a millennium. Look at the way your years are written--there's even an implicit assumption that 10,000 just isn't going to happen. Is there a word for 10,000 years? Probably, somewhere. But I certainly don't know it, do you?

Up until towards the end of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, we had taken to writing dates with the last two digits of the year only. *The Summer of '69*, *Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72*, and so forth. This assumption was coded into a lot of computer systems, sort of, long story short. This became a problem as we neared the end of the century. (I'm sure you all remember this.) So, well, I don't actually know exactly what people did to address this, since you could have done a number of things, but trust me, it was addressed.

People make light of the situation. *The Colbert Report* covered the 2012 election as, well, this is hard to google, but it was something like **Decision '012**, which sounds funny, doesn't it? Generally people agree that the way we use language can reveal deeper truths about the way we think, though they differ on the extent to which this is true. But let's just say that maybe humans aren't too great at planning ahead, which is why a lot of people didn't notice the whole Y2K thing until rather late.

Then there are people like [The Long Now Foundation](http://longnow.org/), who advocate looking further into the future. Interesting folks. They're working, with money donated by Jeff Bezos (~$42 million), on a mechanical clock that ticks once a year, moves the century hand every century, and cuckoos on the millenium. They put a leading zero before their years. This would be 02016. Yes, they're serious. As a heart attack. I think. Brian Eno is on the board.

### Humans live somewhere around 75 or 100 years. 
Most movies are 90 minutes. Most books are around 65,000 words (in English, of course). 500 words in a short essay. An op-ed is about 1,000. Songs are three and a half minutes, we (should) sleep eight hours a day. Cigarettes take about five minutes to smoke, unless they're American Spirits.

Some of these are behavioral and some of them are biological, and some of them are a combination. Sleep is biological, although why we need it is anybody's guess. Cigarettes are about 50/50. You wouldn't want any more nicotine than that (biological), and five-ish minutes is a socially acceptable amount of time (behavioral). Even 100mm cigarettes contain the same amount of actual tobacco/nicotine, the rest is filler.

Commercials are in 30 second increments. This is our attention span for an advertisement. Why? Don't ask me, man, I didn't do it. Do attention spans change as technology does? Well, that's a different blog post, but my overeducated guess is *not really*.

Why do we break clock time down so weirdly? I'm glad you asked. I'm even more glad that [somebody else has already summarized it very well](http://io9.gizmodo.com/5886129/the-short-strange-history-of-decimal-time), including the story of the time the French revolutionaries tried, and failed, to introduce decimal time. So... read that. I'm lazy.

# At any rate,
it's my birthday. Happy birthday to me! My friend suggested taking a picture of myself every day for the next year. Here's today's.
